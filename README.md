# CL-Tile
A game-tile editor built in Common LISP using the cl-cffi-gtk package(s).

Currently, I'm using this repo as a backup. The code as it is right now, February 3rd 2017, will not run correctly. If you want to use this project, I have no problems with it, just realize that there's a crap ton of errors right now.
